# Overview

Fish Audio is a cutting-edge platform for text-to-speech (TTS) and conversational AI. The goal was to design a user-friendly, web-based MVP that would make advanced AI audio creation accessible to a wide audience, from developers building voice apps to creators producing audiobooks, marketing assets, or multilingual content.

# Project Goals

Build an MVP that showcases the potential of AI audio creation.
Create a scalable platform with intuitive workflows and clear navigation.
Differentiate the product visually and experientially in a competitive space.
Support both end-users (content creators) and developers (API integration).

# The Challenge

New Industry: AI audio generation is emerging, with fast-moving competitors.
Differentiation: Identifying a USP and translating it into UX and visuals.
Complexity: Balancing technical features (API, privacy controls) with simplicity and accessibility for non-technical users.

# My Role

I led the design process from research through high-fidelity prototypes. My responsibilities included:
Conducting competitive research and mapping user flows.
Designing wireframes and interactive prototypes.
Developing a distinct UI style with custom icons and illustrations.
Partnering with developers to ensure accurate implementation.

# Project Management & Organization

We ran the project as a design-first MVP sprint, working in close alignment with the product team.
Stakeholder Alignment: Held early workshops to define the core user journeys (voice model creation, API use, discovery features).
Workflows: Mapped features into phased deliverables—starting with essential voice model and API management, then adding engagement features like leaderboards and profiles.

# Design Process & Key Contributions

## Workspace for Voice Models

Problem: Users needed a clear way to create, manage, and control visibility of voice models.
Process: Iterated on wireframes to balance data entry with creative freedom.
Solution: A clean workspace with fields for title, description, tags, and audio samples, plus privacy options (public, unlisted, private).
Outcome: Empowered users to control how their work is shared while tracking progress via a real-time activity feed.

## API Usage Dashboard

Problem: Developers required transparent access to quotas, costs, and documentation.
Process: Studied SaaS usage dashboards to inform structure and hierarchy.
Solution: An API dashboard showing usage as both numbers and visuals (monetary value + bar chart), with secure token generation.
Outcome: Made complex data digestible, encouraging developers to optimize usage plans.

## Leaderboard & User Profiles

Problem: The platform needed mechanisms for engagement and recognition.
Process: Explored gamification strategies while maintaining professional credibility.
Solution: Designed a leaderboard with gold/silver/bronze badges and a profile UI highlighting user activity, likes, and shared models.
Outcome: Boosted discoverability and community interaction, key for retention.

# Collaboration & Handoff

I worked closely with:
Developers: Provided annotated prototypes, icon assets, and responsive guidelines.
PMs: Prioritized features for the MVP and aligned on timelines.
QA: Supported slicing and testing to ensure UI matched design intent across devices.

# Final Outcome

The result was a responsive web platform with:
Voice model creation and management workflows.
Transparent API usage and pricing dashboard.
Engaging community features (leaderboards, profiles).
A consistent visual identity with custom icons and illustrations.

# Results & Impact

Strategic Differentiation: Delivered a distinct user experience in a fast-evolving industry.
User Empowerment: Balanced accessibility for non-technical creators with advanced tools for developers.
Market Positioning: The MVP provided a strong foundation to attract early adopters and investors.

# Reflection & Lessons Learned

What worked: Prioritizing clarity and usability made technical features approachable.
What I’d improve: I would push for earlier user testing with real creators to validate engagement features like leaderboards.
Key takeaway: In emerging industries, design can be the differentiator, making complex technology human-centered and approachable is what unlocks adoption.
