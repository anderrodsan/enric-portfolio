# Overview

This Copenhagen-based startup is developing a tool to help businesses improve their Google search rankings. While I can’t disclose the company name due to confidentiality, I was brought in to establish a comprehensive design system that could scale with the product’s rapid growth. The system not only defined the product’s visual identity but also accelerated the development team’s ability to ship new features with consistency and quality.

# Project Goals

- Create a unified design system that works across product and marketing
- Enable fast iteration with reusable, production-ready components
- Build scalable foundations (tokens, variables, documentation)
- Ensure accessibility and usability for diverse users

# The Challenge

- Zero foundation: No design guidelines beyond a logo
- High complexity: Dashboards + marketing websites
- Rapid delivery: Launch MVP while scaling
- Cross-team alignment: One system for design, dev, and marketing

# My Role

I led the design system effort end-to-end, covering strategic vision, execution, and adoption.

## Foundations & Tokens

- Established color, typography, spacing, radius, and elevation tokens with semantic naming
- Built light/dark mode variables with automatic WCAG AA validation
- Defined responsive grids and typography scales

## Component Architecture

- Designed a library of modular components using Figma variants, auto layout, and interaction states
- Structured components across atoms → molecules → organisms → templates → pages
- Integrated hover, focus, error, success, and loading states

## Application UI Patterns

- Dashboards, audit reports, and SEO keyword tracking tables
- Backlink analysis visualizations and competitor comparison charts
- Documented edge cases and empty states

## Marketing & Brand System

- Website design system: landing pages, pricing, blog, careers, FAQs
- Marketing collateral: campaign modules, testimonials, icons
- Enabled marketing to spin up pages in hours with modular sections

## Documentation & Governance

- Created a living design system hub with usage guidelines and do/don’t patterns
- Partnered with engineering to map tokens into Tailwind CSS + TypeScript
- Defined governance workflows for versioning and contributions

# Project Management & Organization

The project was delivered in five structured sprints:

- Foundations: tokens, type system, grids, accessibility standards
- Core Components: buttons, forms, inputs, navigation, modals, icons
- Application UI: dashboards, audit reports, keyword tables
- Marketing System: modular website templates
- Documentation & Rollout: guidelines, Figma libraries, governance
- Weekly syncs with stakeholders for transparency
- Prioritization driven by developer dependencies
- Sprint reviews with live demos ensured adoption

# Design Process & Key Contributions

## Foundations: Tokens & Variables

Problem: Inconsistent branding with no dark mode support  
Solution: Semantic tokens for color, type, spacing, shadows  
Outcome: Scalable foundation with accessibility and dark/light parity

## Component Library

Problem: Developers recreated components, causing inconsistency  
Solution: Multi-level component system with full variant states  
Outcome: Reduced dev build time by 40%

## Application UI

Problem: SEO data was intimidating for non-technical users  
Solution: Dashboards and reports with modular layouts, states  
Outcome: Improved clarity, reduced cognitive load, built trust

## Marketing System

Problem: One-off design effort for every campaign  
Solution: Reusable page modules matching product design language  
Outcome: Campaign launch cycles cut from weeks to days

# Collaboration & Handoff

- Developers: Tokens mapped directly into Tailwind CSS + TypeScript
- PM: Co-prioritized rollout with roadmap milestones
- Marketing: Empowered with modular system for campaigns
- QA: Supported accessibility audits (ARIA, keyboard, screen reader)

# Final Outcome

- Centralized Figma library unifying product + marketing
- Scalable tokenized foundations with accessibility + dark mode
- Production-ready component library mapped into codebase
- Documentation hub for onboarding, governance, and adoption

# Results & Impact

- 40% faster development cycles via reusable components
- Consistent brand expression across product + marketing
- WCAG AA accessibility compliance
- Positioned startup for scalability and rapid iteration

# Reflection & Lessons Learned

- What worked: Building foundations first reduced rework
- What I’d improve: Run usability testing earlier on data-heavy modules
- Key takeaway: A design system is more than components — it’s the operational backbone that drives velocity, consistency, and confidence
