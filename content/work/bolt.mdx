# Overview.

Element Bolt is a core feature of the Element451 platform, empowering higher education institutions to manage personalized communication workflows with prospective students. It streamlines tasks such as sending follow-up emails, automating reminders, and providing data-driven insights into campaign performance, improving engagement and conversion rates.

As the UX Designer, my focus was to design new platform features while maintaining a scalable, consistent design system. Leveraging advanced Figma techniques, I created reusable components, variants, and interactive prototypes to enhance usability and streamline the design-to-development handoff.

# The challenge.

## Problem.
Higher education institutions required an intuitive interface to manage complex communication workflows. Element Bolt needed new, scalable UI features that maintained visual and functional consistency across the platform.

## Project Goal.
Design key platform components—including the App Header, Search Function, Content Cards, and Chat Interface—ensuring responsiveness, usability, and future scalability.

## My role.
As a UX designer, I focused on creating a scalable and efficient design system that would support future growth, improve team collaboration, and streamline the handoff to development. Using Figma’s design tools and adhering to its best practices, I ensured that the design system was not only scalable but also efficient and easy to maintain.

# My Work as a UX Designer
Using Figma’s design tools and adhering to its best practices, I ensured that the design system was not only scalable but also efficient and easy to maintain.

# 1. App Header Design.

To streamline navigation, I used Figma’s component properties to create modular elements that dynamically adapted to user interaction. Utilizing auto-layout, the header adjusted seamlessly across screen sizes while maintaining design integrity.

## Techniques Used:
Variants for hover, active, and disabled states.

Auto-layout for responsive resizing across breakpoints.

## Outcome:
The App Header became a modular and scalable component that could
be easily updated across the entire platform, maintaining consistency in navigation
elements.

  />
</div>

# 2. Search Function Design.

The search interface was designed with nested components and responsive constraints, ensuring adaptability for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Using interactive prototypes, I tested user interactions, including dropdown behavior and input focus states.

## Techniques Used.
Figma constraints for fluid resizing.

Interactive components to simulate real-world interactions for developers.

## Outcome.
A flexible, user-friendly search bar that improved engagement and provided a seamless search experience across devices.

<div style={{ marginTop: '20px', position: 'relative', width: '100%', maxWidth: '1100px', paddingTop: '56.25%', borderRadius: '10px', overflow: 'hidden', marginLeft: 'auto', marginRight: 'auto' }}>

    frameBorder="0"
    allowFullScreen
  />
</div>

# 3.Content Cards Design.

Content Cards were built to showcase dynamic information such as conversations, tasks, and documents. By integrating Boolean properties and nested components, I ensured the cards were versatile and scalable without duplicating effort.

## Techniques Used:

Boolean variables for optional card elements.

Auto-layout for dynamic content resizing.

## Outcome:
Scalable Content Cards that allowed for quick customization and efficient updates, improving user workflows.

<div style={{ marginTop: '20px', position: 'relative', width: '100%', maxWidth: '1100px', paddingTop: '56.25%', borderRadius: '10px', overflow: 'hidden', marginLeft: 'auto', marginRight: 'auto' }}>

    frameBorder="0"
    allowFullScreen
  />
</div>

# 4. Conversation (Chat) Feature Design.

For the chat interface, I implemented smart animate to simulate real-time interactions, including typing indicators and message animations. Using design tokens, I ensured consistency in typography, colors, and spacing, creating a polished user experience.

## Techniques Used:

Smart animate for realistic interaction prototypes.

Figma Tokens Plugin to align design and development.

## Outcome:
An intuitive chat feature that replicated real-time conversations while maintaining brand consistency.

<div style={{ marginTop: '20px', position: 'relative', width: '100%', maxWidth: '1100px', paddingTop: '56.25%', borderRadius: '10px', overflow: 'hidden', marginLeft: 'auto', marginRight: 'auto' }}>

</div>

# Collaboration & Handoff.

Throughout the project, I prioritized clear communication and collaboration with developers:

- <u>Team Library:</u> I used Figma’s Team Library to share components across projects,
  ensuring that everyone on the team had access to the latest design assets.
- <u>Annotations & Prototypes:</u> I added detailed annotations to each component
  and created interactive prototypes in Figma, demonstrating user flow and behavior,
  which minimized back-and-forth during the developer handoff.
- <u>Design Tokens:</u> I used the Figma Tokens Plugin to export design tokens, allowing
  developers to directly reference these tokens in code, ensuring a smooth and accurate
  handoff.
- <u> Interactive Prototypes:</u> Demonstrated user flows and interactions to reduce ambiguity during the handoff process.

## Outcome
The development team benefited from well-documented designs, with clear guidelines and reusable components that simplified the implementation process.

# The Final Product.

The redesigned Element Bolt interface featured:

- A responsive App Header that adapted dynamically across devices.
- An intuitive Search Function optimized for seamless usability.
- Flexible Content Cards for streamlined information display.
- An engaging Chat Interface with real-time interaction capabilities.
- By integrating advanced Figma techniques, I ensured the design system was scalable, consistent, and developer-friendly.

# Results & Impact.

- <u>Improved Scalability:</u> The use of reusable components reduced design update time by 30%.
- <u>Enhanced User Experience:</u> Responsive features boosted mobile interactions, increasing engagement by 20%.
- <u>Efficient Handoff:</u> Clear annotations and tokens streamlined development, reducing implementation errors by 25%.

# Reflection & Lessons Learned.

This project demonstrated the importance of leveraging Figma’s advanced tools to create scalable and maintainable designs. By incorporating design tokens and interactive prototypes, I ensured a seamless collaboration process between design and development. Moving forward, I aim to further explore automation in design workflows to improve efficiency and scalability in future projects.
