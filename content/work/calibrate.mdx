# Overview
As Calibrate grew from a direct-to-consumer product into a multi-audience business, its navigation failed to reflect new user journeys. I led the redesign of the site’s information architecture and navigation system to:

- Segment by audience (Individuals, Organizations, Employees)
- Guide users to the right content faster
- Introduce flexible CMS-powered editing
- Ensure accessibility, responsiveness, and SEO preservation

# The Challenge
- Confusing journeys: D2C-first nav didn’t serve employers or employees.
- Rigid CMS: Editors couldn’t update navs without dev support.
- Conversion risk: Misaligned journeys meant lost opportunities.

# Process

## Information Architecture
I reorganized the navigation into audience-specific buckets with a set of universal items (Blog, FAQ, Sign In, Am I Eligible?). This gave each user group a clear entry point without overloading the global nav.

## UX/UI Design 

### Desktop Navigation States 
I designed a complete states matrix to ensure usability across hover, active, and keyboard navigation.

- Default State: Clean, minimal links with supporting descriptions.
- Hovered State: Visual promo card appears, highlighting featured content.
- Keyboard Focused State: High-contrast focus styles for accessibility.

### Desktop Dropdown in Context 
This shows how the dropdown fits into the real homepage environment.

- Dropdown overlays cleanly without obscuring core calls to action.
- Featured blog promo balances business needs with user navigation.
- Typography and spacing create clear visual hierarchy.

### Mobile Dropdown (Light & Dark Themes)
For mobile, I designed an accordion-style dropdown that scales across light and dark themes.

- Top-level groups expand/collapse with smooth transitions.
- Featured “Get Started” CTA is pinned for quick access.
- Typography and hit areas sized for touch accessibility.

### Responsive Flow (Dark Theme)
A full end-to-end mobile flow showing the navigation lifecycle:

- Default State (Closed): Clean, unobtrusive menu button.
- Menu Opened: High-contrast panel slides in.
- Dropdown Expanded: Users drill down into audience-specific content.
- Active State: Selected link is highlighted for clarity.

### Responsive Flow (Light Theme)
A parallel version for the light theme to ensure brand consistency across themes.

- Same structure and hierarchy as dark mode.
- Adjusted contrast and focus rings to maintain accessibility.

### Featured Link Variations (With Imagery)
I created featured link cards that supported both text and rich imagery.

- Default → Hover → Active → Focus states documented.
- Integrated imagery to promote blogs or campaigns.
- CTA placement consistent across all states.

### Featured Link Variations (Text Only)
I also designed text-only variations for cases where no campaign image was available.

- Maintains hierarchy through typography and spacing.
- Full state documentation ensures accessibility parity.
- Minimal style reduces visual noise when imagery isn’t needed.

## Accessibility Considerations
Accessibility was a core constraint from the start. This made the navigation inclusive, compliant, and consistent across all interaction methods.

I ensured:

- Full keyboard navigation with clear focus states
- Proper ARIA roles for screen readers
- WCAG-compliant color contrast in light and dark themes
- Larger touch-friendly hit areas on mobile
- Documented all states (default, hover, active, focus) for consistency

# Outcome
- Clarity: Users reach audience-specific content faster.
- Efficiency: Editors can update navs in minutes.
- Growth-ready: Promo slots enabled campaigns directly in navigation.
- Accessibility: Full WCAG compliance across desktop and mobile.

# Reflection
- Win: Balanced business flexibility with clear UX.
- Challenge: SEO preservation during migration.
- Next time: Involve marketing earlier in content strategy.
- Lesson: Navigation isn’t just IA—it’s a strategic design system.
