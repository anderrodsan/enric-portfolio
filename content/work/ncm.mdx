# Overview

The National Children’s Museum (NCM) undergone a complete redesign of its website, focusing on creating a modular, component-based design system that is scalable and efficient. 

The project aimed to create a modern, engaging, and accessible digital experience that reflected the whimsy and joy of the museum’s mission. Working with a talented team of developers, strategists, and content specialists, I was responsible for leading the design process, from initial wireframes to fully designed pages, using best practices in Figma and a robust design system.

# Problem Statement

The existing NCM website had several pain points:

- Poor Mobile Experience: Over 91% of users accessed the site on mobile, yet the site’s performance and usability scored poorly, with an average mobile performance score of just 47.
- Accessibility Barriers: Inconsistent design and outdated functionality created barriers for users with disabilities.
- Complex Maintenance: The site relied on multiple plugins and custom CSS for functionality, complicating updates and maintenance for the internal team.
- Disconnect from Brand: The site failed to capture the playful, whimsical experience of visiting the museum.

# My role

As the UX Designer, my responsibilities included:

- Wireframing: I began by creating detailed, low-fidelity wireframes in Figma to outline the structure and layout of key pages. These wireframes focused on improving navigation, accessibility, and usability for all target audiences.
- Page Design: Building on the wireframes, I developed high-fidelity designs that captured NCM’s unique identity using components, design systems, and Figma best practices. I utilized auto-layout, interactive prototypes, and reusable components to ensure scalability and efficiency.
- Collaboration: I worked closely with developers to ensure a seamless handoff, leveraging Figma's Dev Mode to provide detailed specifications and ensure accurate implementation.

# Design Process

## Wireframing
The first step was to create wireframes that:

- Focused on user journeys for each target audience (e.g., parents, educators, donors).
- Prioritized a mobile-first approach to address the high volume of mobile traffic.
- Enhanced wayfinding by introducing clear navigation paths and breadcrumb trails.

## High-Fidelity Designs
Once the wireframes were finalized, I developed high-fidelity page designs, emphasizing:
- Brand Alignment: Designs reflected NCM’s playful and whimsical identity using vibrant colors, playful typography, and engaging visuals.
- Accessibility: All components were designed to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards, ensuring usability for a diverse audience.
- Scalability: I built a modular design system with reusable components (e.g., buttons, cards, forms) that could be used consistently across the site.

## Figma Best Practices
- Components and Variants: I created reusable components with variants for different states (hover, active, etc.), streamlining design updates.
- Design Tokens: Colors, typography, and spacing were tokenized to maintain consistency and ease developer handoff.
- Prototyping: I created interactive prototypes in Figma to test user flows and gather stakeholder feedback before finalizing designs.
