# Overview.

The Handi-Lift website redesign was a strategic project aimed at modernizing the site to reflect the company’s values and improve usability, accessibility, and engagement. By addressing user feedback, creating a scalable design system, and incorporating best practices in UX, we crafted a solution that aligned with Handi-Lift’s mission to serve diverse audiences, including architects, homeowners, and property managers.

## Project Goals

- Ensure Handi-Lift remains a leading brand in the industry with a visually appealing, modern website.
- Improve user engagement and drive more conversions.
- Improve communication around services provided and expand customer variety.
- Incorporate best accessibility practices to make the website fully accessible to all users.

# The challenge.

The original Handi-Lift website was outdated, heavy, and no longer reflected the evolving needs of the company or its users. 

Recent user feedback and site diagnostics revealed the following key issues:

- <u>Unclear brand messaging:</u> Users found it hard to understand the full range
  of services offered.
- <u>Navigation difficulties:</u> Users had trouble finding relevant information
  and accessing key features, such as product information and contact forms.
- <u>Outdated visual design:</u> The site’s visual design was described as dark and
  unwelcoming. Missed conversion opportunities: The website lacked sufficient touchpoints
  for lead generation and follow-up.
- <u>Missed Conversion Opportunities:</u> Insufficient CTAs and unclear lead generation paths hindered engagement.

# Design Process

As the UX Designer, I led efforts to solve these challenges through user-centered design, a robust design system, and streamlined navigation. I collaborated closely with the team to integrate research insights into actionable solutions, ensuring a cohesive and accessible experience.

## Research & Discovery

- <u>User Interviews:</u> Conducted in-depth interviews to understand the pain points
  users experienced on the existing website.
- <u>SEO & Analytics Review:</u> Analyzed current SEO performance and user behavior
  to identify areas of improvement, such as enhancing organic traffic and engagement.

## Moodboards

- Developed moodboards to align on visual direction, balancing Handi-Lift’s legacy with a brighter, modern look.
- Collaborated with stakeholders to establish a unified design language.
