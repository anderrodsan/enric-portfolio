# Overview.

The Handi-Lift website redesign project focused on creating a modern, user-friendly design that enhances engagement, improves user experience, and adheres to the best accessibility practices. The website redesign addressed critical feedback from users, revamped the content structure, and incorporated a new design system that is scalable and easy to maintain.

The goals of this redesign were to:

- Ensure Handi-Lift remains a leading brand in the industry with a visually appealing, modern website.
- Improve user engagement and drive more conversions.
- Improve communication around services provided and expand customer variety.
- Incorporate best accessibility practices to make the website fully accessible to all users.

# The challenge.

The original Handi-Lift website was outdated, heavy, and no longer reflected the evolving needs of the company or its users. Recent user feedback and site diagnostics revealed the following key issues:

- <u>Unclear brand messaging:</u> Users found it hard to understand the full range
  of services offered.
- <u>Navigation difficulties:</u> Users had trouble finding relevant information
  and accessing key features, such as product information and contact forms.
- <u>Outdated visual design:</u> The site’s visual design was described as dark and
  unwelcoming. Missed conversion opportunities: The website lacked sufficient touchpoints
  for lead generation and follow-up.

# My Work as a UX Designer

Using a UX design thinking process, we focused on creating a human-centered, iterative approach to solve the challenges identified. This process involved empathizing with users, defining their pain points, ideating solutions, prototyping, and testing.

## Research & Discovery

- <u>User Interviews:</u> Conducted in-depth interviews to understand the pain points
  users experienced on the existing website.
- <u>SEO & Analytics Review:</u> Analyzed current SEO performance and user behavior
  to identify areas of improvement, such as enhancing organic traffic and engagement.

## Moodboards

As a team, we created moodboards to explore visual directions, helping us align on the look and feel of the new website. The moodboards were key in establishing a design language that reflects both the legacy and modern vision of Handi-Lift.

## Design System Creation

Developed a comprehensive design system that included:

- Detailed documentation outlining guidelines for typography, color schemes, spacing, and layout structures.
- Reusable UI components to ensure scalability and reduce the cost of future design work.
- Consistent visual design elements to maintain brand identity across all touchpoints.
- Design tokens to streamline the development process and ensure brand consistency in both design and code implementation.
- The design system ensured consistent UI across all pages and components, creating a cohesive experience for users and developers.

## Content Structure & Navigation

- Redesigned the content structure to make navigation more intuitive. This included simplifying the top menu, improving the user flow, and adding new pages for architects and FAQ sections.
- Focused on improving communication around Handi-Lift’s services, particularly for new audiences such as property managers and business owners.

## Visual Design

- Created a fresh, modern look while retaining elements of Handi-Lift’s legacy. The new design is brighter, more welcoming, and visually highlights the company’s 50-year legacy and transformation.
- Designed new product images (animated CAD drawings) to visually explain Handi-Lift’s product offerings. These images were integrated into key pages like the Home Page and Products Page.

# Collaboration & Handoff.

Collaboration with the team was key to the success of this project:

- <u>Workshops & Brainstorming Sessions:</u> Organized design workshops with the
  Handi-Lift team to collaboratively ideate and refine design concepts.
- <u>Prototypes & Feedback:</u> Shared Figma prototypes regularly to gather feedback
  from stakeholders and iterate on the design.
- <u>Moodboards:</u> Used moodboards during the design process to align on the visual
  direction and ensure the design reflected the company’s evolution.
- <u>Handoff to Development:</u> Delivered high-fidelity designs with clear documentation,
  annotations, and design tokens in Figma to ensure a smooth transition to development.

# The Final Product.

The final result was a fully modernized website that reflects Handi-Lift’s values, improves user engagement, and provides a clear path to conversions.

Key features include:

- <u>Improved navigation:</u> Simplified user flow with easy access to important
  information for architects, homeowners, and business owners.
- <u>Optimized for conversions:</u> Clear call-to-action buttons and optimized contact
  forms to capture leads and drive follow-ups.
- <u>New product visuals:</u> Simplified vector graphics of products, replacing outdated
  photography and improving product understanding.

# Results & Impact.

Increase in engagement: Enhanced user experience and a brighter, more modern look led to an increase in time spent on the site and reduced bounce rates.

- <u>Improved SEO:</u> The redesigned content structure and optimized pages helped
  improve organic search traffic and increased the visibility of Handi-Lift’s services.
- <u>Better conversion rates:</u> The inclusion of clear CTAs and better-organized
  contact forms resulted in higher conversion opportunities, with more users submitting
  forms and requests for information.

# Reflection & Lessons Learned.

This project highlighted the importance of balancing brand heritage with modern design trends. By focusing on user feedback and applying the UX design thinking process, I was able to craft a design that not only improved the overall user experience but also enhanced Handi-Lift’s brand presence in a competitive industry. Moving forward, I would continue to emphasize the role of SEO and content structure in improving website performance.
