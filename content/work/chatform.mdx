# Overview.

Chatform is an AI-driven customer support platform designed to streamline support operations through automation, a flexible workflow/bot builder, and omnichannel communication. I was brought in to lead the design of their MVP—from discovery to delivery—ensuring the product was usable, scalable, and strategically aligned with the business goals.

# The challenge.

## Problem.

- <u>Abstract concepts.</u> The client had a strong vision but limited technical references. The first hurdle was translating abstract ideas into a concrete product roadmap.  
- <u>No precedent.</u> No existing interface or framework—we were building from scratch.  
- <u>Complex use cases.</u> We had to accommodate both non-technical support agents and admins with advanced automation needs.  
- <u>Time-boxed.</u> We had just 12 weeks to design and validate the MVP.

## Project Goal.

- <u>Launch a fully functional MVP</u> to validate product-market fit.  
- <u>Design an intuitive interface</u> for both support agents and admins.  
- <u>Build a flexible chatbot & workflow builder</u> that enables automation without code.  
- <u>Create a scalable design system</u> to support future features.  

North star: Reduce operational overhead for support teams while improving response times.

## My role.

As Lead Product Designer, I owned the design direction from discovery through delivery:

- <u>Ran discovery sessions</u> and stakeholder interviews.  
- <u>Defined IA, user flows, and core product architecture.</u>  
- <u>Led UX research</u> and competitive analysis.  
- <u>Produced wireframes, hi-fi UI, and interactive prototypes.</u>  
- <u>Collaborated closely with engineering</u> for smooth handoff and implementation.  
- <u>Partnered with visual design</u> to ensure brand consistency across UI, icons, and marketing.

# Project management & organization.

We followed an agile cadence with weekly check-ins and design sprints.

- <u>Kickoff workshop.</u> Aligned on goals, user segments, and the competitive landscape.  
- <u>Prioritization matrix.</u> Clarified MVP must-haves vs. nice-to-haves.  
- <u>Design reviews.</u> Weekly syncs with PM/engineering to test assumptions and de-risk delivery.  
- <u>Prototyping → dev handoff.</u> Figma components, variants, and prototypes, plus Loom walkthroughs for QA and build.

# My Work as a UX Designer

## Dashboard (Home)

- <u>Problem.</u> New agents needed orientation; experienced agents needed fast access to common actions.  
- <u>Process.</u> Researched onboarding and dashboards (Intercom, Zendesk, Freshdesk).  
- <u>Solution.</u> A home view with shortcuts to core features, knowledge base access, and real-time chat updates.  
- <u>Outcome.</u> Reduced time-to-first-response for new agents; helped teams stay proactive.  
- <u>Value delivered.</u> Clear first-touch experience aligned to agent mental models.

## Bot Builder & Templates

- <u>Problem.</u> Teams needed to automate workflows without coding.  
- <u>Process.</u> Mapped common scenarios (support, feedback, onboarding).  
- <u>Solution.</u> Drag-and-drop builder with pre-built templates and full customization.  
- <u>Outcome.</u> Bots deployable in minutes; easy to extend.  
- <u>Value delivered.</u> Lower dependency on devs; faster automation cycles.

## Widget Settings (Customization)

- <u>Problem.</u> Clients needed the support widget to reflect their brand.  
- <u>Process.</u> Designed real-time customization with live preview and theme presets.  
- <u>Solution.</u> Controls for colors, fonts, avatar styles, tone of voice.  
- <u>Outcome.</u> Fully white-labeled experiences.  
- <u>Value delivered.</u> Increased trust and brand alignment.

## Chat Inbox

- <u>Problem.</u> Agents juggled high volumes across channels with fragmented tools.  
- <u>Process.</u> Interviews to uncover workflows, pain points, and shortcuts.  
- <u>Solution.</u> Unified inbox with filters, real-time attributes, quick replies, and internal notes.  
- <u>Outcome.</u> Centralized, actionable workspace.  
- <u>Value delivered.</u> Faster responses and reduced handling time.

## Contact Importer

- <u>Problem.</u> New customers often migrated from other tools and needed clean data.  
- <u>Process.</u> Researched imports in HubSpot, Intercom, Airtable.  
- <u>Solution.</u> CSV uploader with field mapping, exclusion toggles, and custom property creation.  
- <u>Outcome.</u> Lower onboarding friction.  
- <u>Value delivered.</u> Faster setup for new accounts.

# Collaboration & Handoff.

I collaborated closely across functions to keep feasibility and pace:

- <u>Engineering.</u> Weekly syncs and async reviews to ensure technical fit and pixel accuracy.  
- <u>Product.</u> Translated business goals into shippable slices and milestones.  
- <u>QA.</u> Documented behaviors, states, and edge cases; supported live QA during implementation.  
- <u>Stakeholders.</u> Regular demos to validate progress and refine priorities.  

Handoff package: Structured Figma library, page-level specs, motion/behavior notes, and Loom walkthroughs.

# The Final Product.

The MVP shipped in 12 weeks with:

- <u>Customizable chat widget</u>  
- <u>Scalable drag-and-drop bot builder</u>  
- <u>Multi-channel inbox</u>  
- <u>Robust onboarding tools</u> (knowledge base, imports)  
- <u>Admin dashboard</u> with user-friendly controls  

Everything was built with modular components for future growth—no fluff, just utility.

# Results & Impact.

- <u>Time to value.</u> Bots deployable in 15 minutes.  
- <u>Efficiency.</u> First-response time reduced by ~30% using quick replies and smart filters.  
- <u>Adoption.</u> Positive pilot feedback, especially on the builder’s clarity and speed.  
- <u>Scalability.</u> Componentized system ready for rapid feature iteration.

# Reflection & Lessons Learned.

## What worked ##

- <u>Early, frequent alignment</u> minimized scope creep.  
- <u>Templates delivered value</u> before deeper learning was required.  
- <u>Weekly feedback loops</u> exposed friction before dev handoff.

## What I’d do differently ##

- <u>Invest even earlier in usability testing</u> for complex tools (e.g., the builder).  
- <u>Add a guided onboarding sequence</u> to accelerate first-time success.  
- <u>Define analytics upfront</u> to measure MVP success immediately post-launch.
