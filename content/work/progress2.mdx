# Overview.

Element Bolt is a powerful tool within the Element451 platform, designed to help higher education institutions streamline communication with prospective students through automation and personalization. It allows schools to automate tasks such as sending follow-up emails and reminders while providing personalized marketing messages based on student data. The platform also offers insights into campaign performance with analytics on open rates, click rates, and conversions.

As the UX Designer for Element Bolt, I was responsible for designing key features within the platform while ensuring consistency with the Bolt Design System.

By leveraging Figma’s best practices, I maintained a scalable design language, incorporating components, variants, and auto-layout to create a seamless and efficient user experience.

# The challenge.

- <u>Problem:</u> Higher education institutions need an intuitive way to manage complex
  communication workflows while improving personalization and engagement with prospective
  students. Element Bolt required a consistent, scalable design system to deliver
  this at scale.
- <u>Project Goal:</u> Design new sections for the platform, including the App Header,
  Search Function, Content Cards, and Conversation (Chat) feature, while ensuring
  usability, responsiveness, and design consistency.
- <u>My role:</u> As a UX designer, I focused on creating a scalable and efficient
  design system that would support future growth, improve team collaboration, and
  streamline the handoff to development.

# My Work as a UX Designer

Using Figma’s design tools and adhering to its best practices, I ensured that the design system was not only scalable but also efficient and easy to maintain.

App Header Design

For the App Header, I created reusable components to ensure consistency across all navigation elements. I used variants to switch easily between different states (hover, active, or disabled) without duplicating design efforts. The auto-layout feature ensured that the header adjusted dynamically, allowing for a responsive design that catered to various screen sizes.

<u>Outcome:</u> The App Header became a modular and scalable component that could
be easily updated across the entire platform, maintaining consistency in navigation
elements.

Search Function Design

For the Search Function, I utilized nested components to create a modular, flexible design that adapted across devices. Using Figma’s constraints and resizing features, I ensured that the search bar and dropdown results behaved responsively on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

I also used interactive components to prototype user interactions within Figma, allowing developers to experience the behavior of the search elements during the handoff.

<u>Outcome:</u> The search feature provided a consistent, responsive experience across
different devices, improving user engagement with search functionalities.

Content Cards Design

For the Content Cards, I made extensive use of component properties and boolean variables to control the visibility of optional elements, such as completed tasks. By integrating nested components and auto-layout, I ensured that the cards dynamically adjusted to content changes without manual resizing.

<u>Outcome:</u> The content cards were scalable and efficient, allowing quick toggling
between different card types (conversations, tasks, documents) without the need for
separate components.

Conversation (Chat) Feature Design

The Conversation (Chat) feature required a design that could simulate real-time interactions. I used smart animate within interactive components to prototype user flows such as typing indicators and message sending animations, providing a more realistic and engaging experience.

Additionally, I implemented design tokens within Figma to ensure consistency in color, typography, and spacing across the chat interface.

<u>Outcome:</u> The final chat design offered a seamless, interactive experience,
reflecting real-time communication and maintaining visual consistency.

# Collaboration & Handoff.

Throughout the project, I prioritized clear communication and collaboration with developers:

- <u>Team Library:</u> I used Figma’s Team Library to share components across projects,
  ensuring that everyone on the team had access to the latest design assets.
- <u>Annotations & Prototypes:</u> I added detailed annotations to each component
  and created interactive prototypes in Figma, demonstrating user flow and behavior,
  which minimized back-and-forth during the developer handoff.
- <u>Design Tokens:</u> I used the Figma Tokens Plugin to export design tokens, allowing
  developers to directly reference these tokens in code, ensuring a smooth and accurate
  handoff.

<u>Outcome</u>: The development team benefited from well-documented designs,
with clear guidelines and reusable components that simplified the implementation
process.

# The Final Product.

The final design for Element Bolt was a fully responsive, scalable system that streamlined workflows and improved the user experience. Key features included:

- A modular App Header that dynamically adjusted to user interaction.
- A flexible Search Function with responsive behavior across devices.
- Content Cards that were easy to customize and maintain.
- A conversation (chat) feature with seamless, interactive animations.

<u>Outcome:</u> The design system ensured consistency across the platform while enabling
future scalability and easier maintenance for both designers and developers.

# Results & Impact.

- <u> Improved Scalability:</u> The use of reusable components and design tokens
  drastically reduced the time required to update features or add new ones.
- <u>Enhanced User Experience:</u> The responsive design of key features improved
  engagement across devices, particularly in mobile interactions.
- <u> Efficient Handoff:</u> By using Figma’s best practices and documentation, we
  streamlined the development process, reducing iteration time and improving design
  accuracy.
- <u>Improved SEO:</u> The redesigned content structure and optimized pages helped
  improve organic search traffic and increased the visibility of Handi-Lift’s services.
- <u>Better conversion rates:</u> The inclusion of clear CTAs and better-organized
  contact forms resulted in higher conversion opportunities, with more users submitting
  forms and requests for information.

# Reflection & Lessons Learned.

This project highlighted the importance of design systems in creating scalable and maintainable designs. By leveraging Figma’s full set of tools, we built a system that empowered both the design and development teams. Moving forward, I would continue to prioritize efficient collaboration, ensuring that the design-to-development handoff remains seamless and scalable.
