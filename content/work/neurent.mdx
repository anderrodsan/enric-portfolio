# Overview.

In preparation for Neurent Medical’s Gen 3 product launch, I created a foundational wireframe design system in Figma. This system was designed with scalability, accessibility, and seamless developer handoff in mind, providing a streamlined, component-based approach to support Neurent’s dual-audience needs across both the patient and healthcare provider (HCP) journeys.

The design system’s wireframe setup will serve as the blueprint for Neurent’s website by providing a consistent and efficient structure. The focus here was on creating reusable, responsive components and a well-documented system that enables a seamless transition to high-fidelity design and development.

# The challenge.

The original Handi-Lift website was outdated, heavy, and no longer reflected the evolving needs of the company or its users. Recent user feedback and site diagnostics revealed the following key issues:

- <u>Problem:</u> Neurent’s current dual-site structure is divided between patient
  and provider audiences, creating a fragmented experience. This redesign aimed to
  consolidate their online presence while adhering to accessibility and regulatory
  standards for healthcare.
- <u>Project Goal:</u> Delop a comprehensive, reusable wireframe design system in
  Figma, laying a scalable foundation for the new site. By setting up advanced wireframes
  with robust components, I ensured the design system would streamline future design
  work, reduce development time, and provide a cohesive, accessible experience across
  devices.
- <u>My role:</u> As the UX Designer, I established the entire design system within
  Figma, leveraging best practices to ensure modularity, accessibility, and efficient
  developer handoff. This setup included establishing foundational styles, breakpoints,
  atomic components, and in-depth documentation.

# Design System Setup

To create a design system suitable for wireframes, I focused on several best practices that promote consistency, scalability, and accessibility:

Foundation & Setup

- <u>Core Styles:</u> Established color, typography, and spacing systems as Figma
  Styles, such as Primary, Secondary, and Alert color palettes, along with standardized
  heading and line height settings.
- <u>Design Tokens:</u> Integrated Figma’s Tokens Plugin to create design tokens
  for colors, typography, and spacing. This approach allows for easy updates, ensuring
  consistent style application across components.
- <u>Responsive Breakpoints:</u> Built responsive wrappers for layout elements, ensuring
  seamless adaptation to screen size. By setting up breakpoints within constraints,
  I enabled components to resize dynamically across mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts.

Component Architecture

- <u>Atomic Design Principles:</u> Following atomic design, I built base-level components
  (e.g., buttons, input fields) and combined them into complex components (e.g.,
  cards, modals) to maintain modularity and reusability.
- <u>Variants and Component Properties:</u> Used Figma’s Variants to create multi-state
  components, such as buttons with primary, secondary, hover, and active states,
  adding boolean and text properties for customizability.
- <u>Auto Layout:</u> Applied auto layout within frames to ensure content-adaptive
  design, where components expand or contract based on content or screen size, critical
  for responsive and user-centered wireframes.

Scalability & Consistency

- <u>Global Components and Libraries:</u> Set up a Team Library, organizing components
  by type and function with a clear naming convention for easy navigation. This ensures
  all design assets are centralized, making the system scalable for future needs.
- <u>Flexible Component Wrappers:</u> Built wrappers that can hold varying content
  types without altering the main structure, ideal for modals and panels, ensuring
  consistency without rigid layouts.
- <u>Icon System:</u> Designed an icon component system, allowing icons to be swapped
  seamlessly using instance properties, ensuring visual consistency and reducing
  duplication.

Design System Governance

- <u>Regular Audits & Updates:</u> Established a schedule for periodic audits to
  ensure the system remains aligned with Neurent’s evolving needs.
- <u>Component Versioning:</u> Used Figma’s Team Library update notifications to
  document component changes, minimizing workflow disruptions and maintaining alignment
  across teams.

Visual Design

- Created a fresh, modern look while retaining elements of Handi-Lift’s legacy. The new design is brighter, more welcoming, and visually highlights the company’s 50-year legacy and transformation.
- Designed new product images (animated CAD drawings) to visually explain Handi-Lift’s product offerings. These images were integrated into key pages like the Home Page and Products Page.

# Key Deliverables & Impact.

The advanced wireframe design system provided a structured, modular foundation that addressed Neurent’s goals, from enhanced usability to consistent, scalable design elements:

- <u>Unified User Flow:</u> A streamlined layout for patients and HCPs with tailored
  components, improving navigation and engagement.
- <u>Conversion-Ready Layouts:</u> Optimized navigation elements and CTAs within
  wireframes to enhance user experience and encourage conversions.
- <u>Accessible, Responsive Structure:</u> A robust framework that adapts to different
  screen sizes and meets WCAG 2.2 standards, providing an inclusive experience.

# Reflection & Next Steps.

This wireframe phase underscored the value of a well-structured, modular design system in accelerating development and ensuring consistency across devices. Moving forward, the high-fidelity phase will apply brand elements to this foundation, creating a polished, accessible digital presence ready for Neurent’s Gen 3 launch.
