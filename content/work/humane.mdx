# Overview.

The “Humane Website Build” project was a collaborative effort between Cantilever and Humane AI, with a focus on building a streamlined, component-based single-page layout and checkout flow.

## My role: Project Manager.

As Project Manager for Cantilever, I worked closely with the lead of UX design and Humane’s internal team, who managed final visual design with consulting input from our side. 

While Cantilever led the UX, development, and final launch, the overall project oversight was handled by Humane's designated project manager, with me focusing specifically on Cantilever’s responsibilities, ensuring consistent project updates via a shared tracking system.

Our initial design targeted a minimal viable product (V1), prioritizing the core components—mobile homepage, Product Detail Page (PDP), and purchase page—to establish an intuitive, efficient user journey.

# The challenge.

## Problem
Humane AI's existing mobile experience lacked clarity in the PDP layout, resulting in a high bounce rate during checkout.

## Project Goal
Our primary goal was to simplify the user journey, enabling easy product discovery and a seamless checkout process that would increase conversions,particularly for mobile users.

# Project Management and Organization.

As Cantilever’s Project Manager, I ensured efficient task management, communication, and alignment on deliverables by collaborating with the Senior UX Designer to refine wireframes for accessibility, created detailed mockups, and streamlined the checkout flow based on user journey analysis.

## 1. Coordination with Stakeholders
Acting as the main point of contact, I ensured seamless communication between Cantilever’s team and Humane’s internal team, providing continuous updates on progress

## 2. Organizing Design Sessions & Workshops
I facilitated collaborative sessions and workshops, gathering input to align on UX decisions and component design.

## 3. Weekly Meetings & Task Tracking
Managed weekly status meetings to discuss progress, review designs, and confirm next steps. Clear task delegation was handled through Asana to keep the project on track.

## 4. Prioritizing Key Deliverables
Oversaw the development of core components,including the mobile homepage UX, PDP, and checkout pages, ensuring all deadlines were met and feedback was incorporated.

# Collaboration & UX Design Guidance.

In collaboration with Cantilever’s Senior UX Designer, I provided guidance and feedback to meet Humane’s UX objectives.

## Homepage

- <u>Low-Fidelity Mockups:</u> We started with low-fidelity wireframes to establish
  a clear user flow, focusing on mobile accessibility and ease of navigation.
- <u>High-Fidelity Mockups:</u> Transitioned into high-fidelity designs, using Figma’s
  components, variants, and auto-layout to ensure the design remained flexible across
  screen sizes.

## Outcome

The mobile-optimized homepage enabled intuitive navigation, with an improved product display that facilitated quick discovery.

</div>

# Product Detail & Purchase Pages (PDP and Checkout)

## Responsive Wireframes & Component-Based Design
We refined the layout of the
Product Detail Page (PDP) to improve product information clarity and ease of selection,
ensuring a consistent user experience across all screens. Both the PDP and Purchase
Page utilized component-based designs in Figma, leveraging properties and variants for
uniformity.
## Optimized Checkout Flow
For the Purchase Page, we focused on streamlining the
checkout process, especially on mobile, to reduce user friction. Interactive, responsive
wireframes showcased an optimized user journey, making it easy for developers to
implement the design seamlessly.

## Outcome
The refined PDP and Purchase Page layouts provided an intuitive, responsive
experience, enhancing both browsing and checkout usability to increase purchase completions.

# Collaboration & Handoff Process.

To ensure a smooth transition from design to development:

- <u>Figma Handoff with Annotations:</u> Delivered annotated high-fidelity wireframes,
  detailing each design element for the development team.
- <u>Regular Feedback Loop:</u> Coordinated feedback sessions with both the Senior
  UX Designer and Humane’s team to align on real-time updates and business objectives
- <u>Weekly Review & Tracking:</u> Conducted weekly Asana reviews, tracking task
  completion and resolving any project blockers promptly.

# Final Outcome.

The Humane Website Build project delivered a highly optimized, user-focused design for the mobile homepage, PDP, and checkout process. By leveraging Figma’s toolkit—including components, variants, auto-layout, and design tokens—we built a flexible, scalable design system that improved both product engagement and checkout completion rates.

# Results & Impact.

- <u>+25% Conversion Rate</u>: Mobile conversion rates increased by 25% due to checkout flow improvements.
- <u>Enhanced Mobile Experience:</u> Optimized designs for mobile improved navigation
  and ease of use, creating a smoother user journey.
- <u>Improved PDP for Conversions:</u> Streamlined the PDP layout simplified product
  browsing and selection.
- <u>Higher Conversion Rates:</u> Early testing indicated increased conversions,
  attributed to the optimized purchase flow and improved mobile usability.{" "}

# Reflection & Lessons Learned.

This project reinforced the importance of iterative feedback in UX design and strengthened my ability to create mobile-first solutions that drive results. 

By maintaining organized weekly updates, structured feedback loops, and consistent stakeholder alignment, we delivered high-quality UX designs on schedule. 

Moving forward, I would continue to emphasize mobile-first design in checkout flows and homepage optimizations, especially for e-commerce-driven projects.
