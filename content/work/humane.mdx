# Overview.

The “Humane Website Build” project was a collaborative effort between Cantilever and Humane AI, with a focus on building a streamlined, component-based single-page layout and checkout flow.

As Project Manager for Cantilever, I worked closely with the lead of UX design and Humane’s internal team, who managed final visual design with consulting input from our side. While Cantilever led the UX, development, and final launch, the overall project oversight was handled by Humane's designated project manager, with me focusing specifically on Cantilever’s responsibilities, ensuring consistent project updates via a shared tracking system.

Our initial design targeted a minimal viable product (V1), prioritizing the core components—mobile homepage, Product Detail Page (PDP), and purchase page—to establish an intuitive, efficient user journey.

# The challenge.

- <u>Problem:</u> Humane AI needed a mobile-first, user-centered experience across
  key sections of their site, including a single-page layout, PDP, and checkout flow.
- <u>Project Goal:</u> Our primary goal was to simplify the user journey, enabling
  easy product discovery and a seamless checkout process that would increase conversions,
  particularly for mobile users.
- <u>My role:</u> Our primary goal was to simplify the user journey, enabling easy
  product discovery and a seamless checkout process that would increase conversions,
  particularly for mobile users.

# Project Management and Organization.

As Cantilever’s Project Manager, I ensured efficient task management, communication, and alignment on deliverables:

- <u>Coordination with Stakeholders:</u> Acting as the main point of contact, I ensured
  seamless communication between Cantilever’s team and Humane’s internal team, providing
  continuous updates on progress
- <u>Organizing Design Sessions & Workshops:</u> I facilitated collaborative sessions
  and workshops, gathering input to align on UX decisions and component design.
- <u>Weekly Meetings & Task Tracking:</u> Managed weekly status meetings to discuss
  progress, review designs, and confirm next steps. Clear task delegation was handled
  through Asana to keep the project on track.
- <u>Prioritizing Key Deliverables:</u> Oversaw the development of core components,
  including the mobile homepage UX, PDP, and checkout pages, ensuring all deadlines
  were met and feedback was incorporated.

# Collaboration & UX Design Guidance.

In collaboration with Cantilever’s Senior UX Designer, I provided guidance and feedback to meet Humane’s UX objectives.

## Homepage:

- <u>Low-Fidelity Mockups:</u> We started with low-fidelity wireframes to establish
  a clear user flow, focusing on mobile accessibility and ease of navigation.
- <u>High-Fidelity Mockups:</u> Transitioned into high-fidelity designs, using Figma’s
  components, variants, and auto-layout to ensure the design remained flexible across
  screen sizes.

Outcome

- The mobile-optimized homepage enabled intuitive navigation, with an improved product display that facilitated quick discovery.

# Collaboration & Handoff Process.

To ensure a smooth transition from design to development:

- <u>Figma Handoff with Annotations:</u> Delivered annotated high-fidelity wireframes,
  detailing each design element for the development team.
- <u>Regular Feedback Loop:</u> Coordinated feedback sessions with both the Senior
  UX Designer and Humane’s team to align on real-time updates and business objectives
- <u>Weekly Review & Tracking:</u> Conducted weekly Asana reviews, tracking task
  completion and resolving any project blockers promptly.

# Final Outcome.

The Humane Website Build project delivered a highly optimized, user-focused design for the mobile homepage, PDP, and checkout process. By leveraging Figma’s toolkit—including components, variants, auto-layout, and design tokens—we built a flexible, scalable design system that improved both product engagement and checkout completion rates.

# Results & Impact.

- <u>Enhanced Mobile Experience:</u> Optimized designs for mobile improved navigation
  and ease of use, creating a smoother user journey.
- <u>Improved PDP for Conversions:</u> Streamlined the PDP layout simplified product
  browsing and selection.
- <u>Higher Conversion Rates:</u> Early testing indicated increased conversions,
  attributed to the optimized purchase flow and improved mobile usability.{" "}

# Reflection & Lessons Learned.

This project underscored the value of strong project management and effective communication. By maintaining organized weekly updates, structured feedback loops, and consistent stakeholder alignment, we delivered high-quality UX designs on schedule. Moving forward, I would continue to emphasize mobile-first design in checkout flows and homepage optimizations, especially for e-commerce-driven projects.
