### Description

Provide tenants an easy way to communicate, exchange products, get help and increase
engagement.

## Problem

Having lived in a dorm for 2 years and served on the resident council, I observed
that most dorm issues stem from communication problems.{" "}

## Current services

In Denmark, dorms typically make use of multiple platforms:

- **Websites:** For public communication, news, events, etc., usually maintained by third-party companies.
- **Facebook:** For public communication relating to news, events, etc.
- **Email:** For private messages such as issue requests, etc.

## Issues with current services

However, the usage of those platforms usually comes with the following issues:

- **Scattered Communication Platforms:** Tenants often feel lost with the variety of services, especially when moving in, and there is no existing dorm-tailored platform yet.
- **Facebook:** Overloaded with features and distractions.
- **Emails:** Important messages can easily get lost or buried.
- **Websites:** Require maintenance by third-party companies.

## Solution

To address these issues, I developed DormHive. This app consolidates all dorm-related communication into one easy-to-use platform, combining the best features of existing services while eliminating their drawbacks.

### Key Features

- **Feed:** Everything in one place. Shortcuts, upcoming. events, news...
- **Alerts and News:** Get relevant alerts and news from the administration.
- **Chat Groups:** Custom groups for each tenants based on their room.
- **Events:** Create and view events happening in the dorm.
- **Marketplace:** Sell and trade products with other tenants.
- **Report Issues:** Easily report issues to the admin and keep track of their state.
- **Book Facilities:** Offer tenants a way to reserve facilities or equipment.

## Design

The initial wireframes were designed by using Figma. These prototypes look really flat and without much personality, but they served as a starting point to achieve the current result.
