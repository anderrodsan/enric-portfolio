# Overview.

This UX research project focuses on the implementation of hybrid education using Moodle, a learning management system (LMS), at Gulu University, Uganda. The goal of the research is to understand how Moodle can effectively blend traditional and online teaching methods, enhancing the learning experience for both students and instructors.

As a UX Researcher from Aalborg University in Copenhagen, my role involves studying Moodle’s functionalities, strategizing its integration, and evaluating its impact on the educational experience. The project employs User-Centered Design methodologies, actively engaging stakeholders (teachers, students, and IT personnel) to ensure that the system is tailored to their specific needs.

# The challenge.

- <u>Problem:</u> Gulu University aims to integrate Moodle into its hybrid learning
  model effectively, but the university needs insight into the platform’s usability
  and impact on both students and instructors.
- <u>Project Goal:</u> Assess Moodle’s effectiveness, strategize its integration,
  and optimize its functionalities to ensure a seamless hybrid learning experience.
- <u>My role:</u> As a UX Researcher, I lead the discovery phase to understand user
  needs and behaviors through qualitative and quantitative research methods, co-design
  workshops, and participatory design.

# My Work as a UX Researcher.

I employed a User-Centered Design approach, engaging directly with stakeholders to collect qualitative and quantitative data. My research focuses on understanding user needs, assessing Moodle’s functionalities, and strategizing its integration into Gulu University’s hybrid learning system.

Discovery Phase

In the discovery phase, I focus on comprehensive research into the problem space, framing the issues to address, and gathering evidence to guide the next steps. The aim is to identify the correct problems and align stakeholders around shared goals for hybrid education.

Key outcomes of the discovery phase:

- <u>Understanding Users:</u> Through qualitative research, I gather deep insights
  into the needs and challenges of students and instructors.
- <u>Comprehending Problems and Opportunities:</u> I investigate the root causes
  of current issues within Moodle, identifying opportunities to improve the hybrid
  learning experience.
- <u>Shared Vision:</u> Collaborating with stakeholders, I ensure alignment on business
  objectives and desired outcomes for the project.

Research Methods

I used a blend of qualitative and quantitative methods to gain a holistic view of the user experience. My research methodology spans the following areas:

- <u>Qualitative Research:</u> Conducted interviews and ethnographic studies with
  students and instructors to understand their experiences and challenges with Moodle.
  Participatory Design: Led co-design workshops involving key stakeholders like Wency
  (teacher) and the IT department to collaboratively identify pain points and solutions.
- <u>Quantitative Research:</u> Deployed surveys and data analytics to gather measurable
  insights and validate assumptions about student behavior within Moodle. Additionally,
  I view UX research through two lenses:
- <u>Attitudinal Research:</u> Understanding user perspectives through interviews
  and focus groups.
- <u>Behavioral Research:</u> Observing how users interact with Moodle through direct
  observation and task analysis.

# Key Techniques Employed.

Workshops for Collaborative Insights

- <u>Co-Design Workshop:</u> Facilitated a session with teachers and the IT department
  to address challenges in using Moodle for hybrid learning. This workshop provided
  valuable insights into user pain points and identified potential areas for improvement.
- <u>ICT Skills Workshop:</u> Organized an ICT workshop for students, aimed at enhancing
  digital literacy with tools like Google Drive. This helped surface specific challenges
  in students' tech proficiency, highlighting areas for skill development.
- <u>Stakeholder Mapping Session:</u> Conducted a stakeholder mapping session to
  ensure inclusive design, mapping students' and teachers' roles and influence on
  hybrid learning adoption.

User-Centered Data Collection

- <u>Interviews:</u> Conducted in-depth interviews with students to gather qualitative
  data, which informed the development of personas and empathy maps, ensuring an
  authentic representation of user experiences.
- <u>Surveys:</u> Administered surveys to collect quantitative data, validating user
  needs and identifying behavioral patterns across the student population.

Process and Interaction Analysis

- <u>Task Analysis:</u> Collaborated with the IT department to analyze user interactions
  with Moodle, identifying friction points and optimizing key processes.
- <u>Pain Points Analysis:</u> Mapped pain points specific to the student onboarding
  process on Moodle, working closely with the IT team to co-create solutions for
  a smoother user experience.

Each technique contributed to a comprehensive understanding of user needs, helping to build a more effective, user-friendly Moodle experience for hybrid learning.
