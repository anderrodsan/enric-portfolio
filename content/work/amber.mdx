# Overview

In November 2024, Valencia, Spain, experienced catastrophic floods that claimed over 200 lives. The Civil Protection Agency issued an emergency alert, advising residents to avoid travel. However, the alert's delayed timing and unclear messaging meant many residents were already stranded or underestimated the severity of the threat.

This project examines how an improved UX for emergency alerts could have changed outcomes during the Valencia floods. By redesigning the alert system, we aimed to make critical information actionable, location-specific, and accessible to save lives in future crises.

# The Challenge.

## The Problem

The Valencia flooding incident revealed critical UX issues in the emergency alert system, making it less effective during a life-threatening crisis:

- Delayed and Overloaded Communication: The alert arrived late and was overly text-heavy, increasing cognitive load and slowing response times.
- Poor Visual and Auditory Design: Lack of standout visuals and generic tones caused users to underestimate the urgency.
- Unclear Actionability: The alert failed to provide clear, step-by-step guidance, leaving users unsure of how to act.
- Desensitization Risk: Frequent use of similar tones in non-urgent notifications diminished the perceived importance of the alert.

## The Goal
To design an emergency alert system that ensures timely, understandable, and actionable guidance for users during crises like floods, with a focus on clarity and user-centered design.

# UX Goals and Objectives

- <u>User-Centric Language:</u> Simplify instructions and emphasize key actions for better comprehension under stress.  
- <u>Geolocation-Specific Information:</u> Use location data to personalize alerts and show relevance to users’ immediate surroundings.  
- <u>Visual and Auditory Cues:</u> Differentiate alerts with unique tones and visuals for better recognition.  
- <u>Actionable Guidance:</u> Provide clear steps users can take to protect themselves.  
- <u>Accessibility:</u> Ensure all users can interact with alerts through compliance with WCAG standards.

# Key UX Techniques Used

## Observational Research:
Analyzed public feedback from media and social media about the Valencia flood alerts. The findings shaped the redesign to address real-world issues of delayed action and miscommunication.  

## Wireframes & Prototyping:
eveloped wireframes and interactive prototypes in Figma to prioritize clarity, urgency, and user guidance.  

## User Testing:
Tested prototypes with users to evaluate response times and comprehension, refining designs based on actionable feedback.  

# Key UX Improvements

## Concise, Language-Optimized Messaging
- <u>Problem:</u> The Valencia flood alert contained lengthy text that was difficult to process in a high-stress situation.  
- <u>Solution:</u> Simplified messages with bullet points, bolded action steps, and concise instructions in the user’s preferred language.  
- <u>Outcome:</u> Faster response times as users could immediately grasp essential information.

## Location-Specific Information with Clear Relevance
- <u>Problem:</u> Users couldn’t gauge how close the threat was to their location.  
- <u>Solution:</u> Integrated geolocation to display users’ proximity to flood zones with a simple indicator instead of a complex map.  
<u>Outcome:</u> Helped users make informed decisions about evacuation or sheltering.

## Visual Cues for Urgent Recognition
- <u>Problem:</u> Generic tones and visuals caused users to dismiss the alert.  
- <u>Solution:</u> Introduced unique sounds and icons for flood alerts, paired with color-coded visuals to signify severity.  
- <u>Outcome:</u> Users recognized the type and urgency of the alert more effectively.

## Actionable Guidance with Immediate Steps
- <u>Problem:</u> Alerts lacked actionable instructions, leading to confusion.  
- <u>Solution:</u> Added “What to Do” and “What Not to Do” sections:  
- <u>Outcome:</u> Users had clear, immediate steps for safer responses.

## Follow-Up and Resolution Notifications
- <u>Problem:</u> Residents received no updates, leaving them anxious and disengaged.  
- <u>Solution:</u> Designed notifications for updates and final resolution alerts when the situation was safe.  
- <u>Outcome:</u> Reduced anxiety and increased trust in the alert system.

# Psychological Insights Applied

- <u>Habituation:</u> Unique tones and visuals reduced alert fatigue, ensuring users remained engaged.  
- <u>Priming Effect:</u> Icons and visuals supported faster recognition, enabling users to respond more quickly.  
- <u>Singularity Effect:</u> Personalized location-specific alerts made the threat feel real and urgent.  
- <u>Bystander Effect:</u> Individual action steps empowered users to take responsibility rather than relying on others.  
- <u>Closure:</u> Follow-up messages provided emotional resolution, fostering trust and future engagement with alerts.
