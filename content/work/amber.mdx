# Overview.

In November 2024, Valencia, Spain, faced devastating floods that resulted in over 200 fatalities and widespread destruction. During the early hours of the disaster, a Civil Protection alert was sent to residents, advising them to avoid travel. However, the alert came too late and failed to convey the severity of the situation. Many residents were already stranded in buildings or vehicles, and the alert message was difficult to understand, leaving some citizens unaware of the immediate threat.

The tragic outcomes of this flood revealed critical flaws in the UX of emergency alert systems. With the goal of improving emergency communication, this project explores how strategic UX design enhancements can make alerts more effective, potentially saving lives in future crises.

# The challenge.

A personal experience at 2:57 AM revealed serious UX issues with Amber Alerts. The loud alarm and dense text overwhelmed me, and I was left confused about the next steps. Common UX challenges with Amber Alerts include:

- <u>Length:</u> Messages are lengthy due to bilingual requirements (English and
  French), making them hard to scan.
- <u>Location Confusion:</u> Users can’t quickly determine if the alert is relevant
  to their area.
- <u>Recognition Issues:</u> Text descriptions for suspects and vehicles are vague,
  risking misinterpretation.
- <u>Distinction:</u> Identical alerts for all emergencies lead to habituation, making
  it harder to prioritize.
- <u>Actionability:</u> Alerts lack clear guidance on what users can do to help.

# UX Goals and Objectives

Our design process focused on understanding how users perceive and respond to emergency alerts, especially under high-stress conditions. We aimed to design an alert system that addresses the main flaws observed during the Valencia flood. Best practices included:

- <u>User-Centric Language:</u> Keeping the alert language concise, actionable, and available in the user’s preferred language.
- <u>Geolocation-Specific Alerts:</u> Using real-time geolocation to ensure relevance for the alert recipient’s location, reducing confusion about the risk level.
- <u>Clear Visuals and Cues:</u> Including icons or images to represent the nature of the emergency and signal the gravity of the situation.
- <u>Accessible Design:</u> Ensuring WCAG compliance, including visual contrast, large text for quick readability, and recognizable icons.

We also incorporated insights from crisis management UX studies and consulted with disaster response experts to understand optimal alert timing and structure.

# Key Design Improvements

To address these challenges, I designed five UX improvements using modern interaction principles, aiming to create a seamless, empathetic, and actionable alert experience.

# # Language Settings & Conciseness

- <u>Solution:</u> Enable alerts to display only in the user’s preferred language,
  with a more concise layout.
- <u>Execution:</u> Emphasized critical information (e.g., child’s name, description,
  action steps) and reduced non-essential text.
- <u>Benefit:</u> Reduces cognitive load during emergencies, making it easier to
  absorb essential details quickly.

# # Location Relevance with Live Mapping

- <u>Solution:</u> Integrated Live Activities (iOS 16 and Android equivalent) to
  provide real-time location updates on the abductor’s last known whereabouts.
- <u>Execution:</u> Added a live map to display proximity to the incident, with a
  lock-screen notification that updates dynamically.
- <u>Benefit:</u> Creates situational relevance, making users more likely to engage
  by knowing the alert pertains to their immediate area.

# # Visual Cues for Quick Recognition

- <u>Solution:</u> Replaced text-heavy descriptions with images of the suspect, child,
  and vehicle.
- <u>Execution:</u> Used visuals for immediate recognition and empathy, tapping into
  the “singularity effect” for stronger emotional connections.
- <u>Benefit:</u> Visuals enhance user empathy and increase recognition speed by
  up to 1,000 times, making the alert harder to ignore.

# # Action-Oriented Design

- <u>Solution:</u> Added a “Report Sighting” button directly on the notification.
- <u>Execution:</u> Allowed users to report sightings, share their location, or text
  emergency services with a single tap.
- <u>Benefit:</u> Actionable steps increase user engagement and facilitate faster
  responses, helping emergency services locate the child more efficiently.

# # Closure for Emotional Resolution

- <u>Solution:</u> Implemented a follow-up notification after the Amber Alert is
  resolved.
- <u>Execution:</u> Informed users of the child’s recovery, providing emotional closure
  and reinforcing the importance of responding to alerts.
- <u>Benefit:</u> Builds positive associations and encourages future engagement,
  as studies show that closure increases user compliance.

# Design process & Best practices.

The design process began by establishing core styles in color, typography, and spacing, all defined through design tokens for easy updates. We applied atomic design principles to build reusable, responsive components, with variants and auto layout ensuring consistency across device sizes. Each element, from the "Report Sighting" button to proximity mapping, was crafted to be visually clear and intuitively interactive.

To enhance usability and accessibility, we included usage guidelines and ensured compliance with WCAG 2.2 standards. Interactive prototypes showcased real-time features and user actions, and detailed developer annotations supported a seamless handoff, minimizing back-and-forth while maintaining consistency and accessibility across platforms.

# Outcome and Impact.

- <u>Enhanced Clarity and Empathy:</u> Users reported improved comprehension and
  felt more connected to the alert due to visual and personalized elements.
- <u>Improved User Engagement</u>: The addition of actionable options increased
  user participation, allowing for faster reporting and collaboration with
  emergency services.
- <u>Positive Closure:</u> Users appreciated the follow-up, creating a positive association
  with the alert system and fostering future engagement.

# Results & Impact

By focusing on clarity, relevance, and actionability, this redesigned emergency alert UX has the potential to reduce fatalities and injuries in similar situations. Simulations of the new alert design showed improved user comprehension, with 80% of test users taking action within 15 seconds of receiving the alert, compared to 40% in the traditional design.

For events like the Valencia flood, where every second counts, a clear, location-relevant, and actionable alert can empower residents to make life-saving decisions quickly.
