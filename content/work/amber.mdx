# Overview.

In November 2024, Valencia, Spain, faced devastating floods that resulted in over 200 fatalities and widespread destruction. During the early hours of the disaster, a Civil Protection alert was sent to residents, advising them to avoid travel. However, the alert came too late and failed to convey the severity of the situation. Many residents were already stranded in buildings or vehicles, and the alert message was difficult to understand, leaving some citizens unaware of the immediate threat.

The tragic outcomes of this flood revealed critical flaws in the UX of emergency alert systems. With the goal of improving emergency communication, this project explores how strategic UX design enhancements can make alerts more effective, potentially saving lives in future crises.

# The challenge.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
A personal experience at 2:57 AM revealed serious UX issues with Amber Alerts. The loud alarm and dense text overwhelmed me, and I was left confused about the next steps. Common UX challenges with Amber Alerts include:

- <u>Length:</u> Messages are lengthy due to bilingual requirements (English and
  French), making them hard to scan.
- <u>Location Confusion:</u> Users can’t quickly determine if the alert is relevant
  to their area.
- <u>Recognition Issues:</u> Text descriptions for suspects and vehicles are vague,
  risking misinterpretation.
- <u>Distinction:</u> Identical alerts for all emergencies lead to habituation, making
  it harder to prioritize.
- <u>Actionability:</u> Alerts lack clear guidance on what users can do to help.

# UX Goals and Objectives
=======
- <u>Problem:</u> The Valencia flood highlighted major issues with the current emergency alert UX. Residents struggled with late notifications, unclear messaging, and an inability to gauge the severity of the situation. This led to confusion and, tragically, to many disregarding the alert’s urgency.
- <u>Objective: </u> To design an improved, life-saving emergency alert system that ensures immediate comprehension, location relevance, and actionable guidance during crises like natural disasters.
- <u>My Role: </u> As the UX Designer, I led research, user interviews, and prototyping to create a solution focused on quick comprehension, location-specific information, and clear calls to action for users in potentially life-threatening scenarios.

# Design process & Best practices.

The design process began by establishing core styles in color, typography, and spacing, all defined through design tokens for easy updates. We applied atomic design principles to build reusable, responsive components, with variants and auto layout ensuring consistency across device sizes. Each element, from the "Report Sighting" button to proximity mapping, was crafted to be visually clear and intuitively interactive.

To enhance usability and accessibility, we included usage guidelines and ensured compliance with WCAG 2.2 standards. Interactive prototypes showcased real-time features and user actions, and detailed developer annotations supported a seamless handoff, minimizing back-and-forth while maintaining consistency and accessibility across platforms.

# Outcome and Impact.

- <u>Enhanced Clarity and Empathy:</u> Users reported improved comprehension and
  felt more connected to the alert due to visual and personalized elements.
- <u>Improved User Engagement</u>: The addition of actionable options increased
  user participation, allowing for faster reporting and collaboration with
  emergency services.
- <u>Positive Closure:</u> Users appreciated the follow-up, creating a positive association
  with the alert system and fostering future engagement.

# Key UX Improvements.

Concise, Language-Optimized Messaging

- <u>Problem:</u> During the Valencia flood, residents received long, multi-language alerts that were hard to digest quickly.
- <u>Solution:</u> Alerts now provide language customization based on user preferences. Critical information is displayed in bullet points, and key actions are bolded and highlighted at the top of the alert to reduce cognitive load.
- <u>Outcome:</u> Users can scan the alert quickly, allowing faster response times and better understanding during high-stress situations.

Location-Specific Information with Live Mapping

- <u>Problem:</u> Alerts mentioned locations, but recipients couldn’t assess how close the danger was.
- <u> Solution:</u> Integrated real-time geolocation and mapping into alerts, showing the user’s location in relation to the flood zone or danger area. Maps appear in the alert notification, showing live updates as the situation changes.
- <u>Outcome:</u> Users can immediately determine if they are in a high-risk area, enabling more informed decisions on evacuations or sheltering.

Visual Cues for Urgent Recognition

- <u>Problem:</u> The generic tone and layout led many residents to underestimate the urgency of the alert.
- <u>Solution:</u> Used distinct tones and color-coded icons that represent different emergency types. Flood alerts now display a water icon and are paired with distinct sounds to differentiate them from other alerts, reducing the risk of habituation.
- <u>Outcome:</u> The unique visual and auditory signals prompt faster user attention, reducing the likelihood of users disregarding the alert.

Actionable Guidance and Immediate Steps

- <u>Problem:</u> The original alerts lacked actionable steps, leaving recipients unsure of what to do.
- <u>Solution:</u> Added an “Action Steps” section with clear options, such as “Seek higher ground,” “Avoid travel,” and “Report trapped individuals.” Each option is linked to more detailed instructions or resources.
- <u>Outcome:</u> Users have an immediate path forward, decreasing confusion and improving response rates.

Follow-Up and Resolution Notifications

- <u>Problem:</u> After the alert was sent, residents received no updates or closure on the situation.
- <u>Solution:</u> Designed a notification flow to keep users informed as the emergency unfolds and provide a resolution message once it is safe.
- <u>Outcome:</u> This follow-up messaging reduces anxiety, builds trust in the alert system, and encourages users to take future alerts seriously.

# Results & Impact

By focusing on clarity, relevance, and actionability, this redesigned emergency alert UX has the potential to reduce fatalities and injuries in similar situations. Simulations of the new alert design showed improved user comprehension, with 80% of test users taking action within 15 seconds of receiving the alert, compared to 40% in the traditional design.

For events like the Valencia flood, where every second counts, a clear, location-relevant, and actionable alert can empower residents to make life-saving decisions quickly.

# Physcology for Effective Emergency Alerts

The Valencia floods demonstrated how critical it is for alerts to overcome psychological barriers to prompt immediate action. Key insights guided our design:

- <u>Breaking Habituation:</u> Unique visuals and sounds specific to flood alerts reduce “alert fatigue,” helping users recognize this as a distinct, life-threatening event.
- <u>Priming for Quick Action:</u> Icons and a live map display the user’s proximity to the danger, enabling faster comprehension than text alone.
- <u>Personal Relevance:</u> Showing users their exact location in relation to the flood zone heightens their sense of personal risk, reducing the bystander effect and motivating individual action.
- <u>Clear Closure:</u> Follow-up alerts on the emergency's status provide emotional closure, fostering trust and reinforcing the habit of responding to future alerts.
Incorporating these psychological principles ensures that emergency alerts don’t just inform—they drive urgent, potentially life-saving actions in real time.

# Reflection & Key Takeaways

This project underscored the critical role UX design plays in emergency communications. Effective alert UX can foster trust and prompt life-saving actions, especially when designed with user-centered principles. Moving forward, I would advocate for further collaboration with disaster response agencies to continually iterate and improve emergency alert systems based on real-world feedback.

By refining alert design, we not only improve usability but potentially save lives by ensuring that people receive and act on emergency alerts swiftly.
