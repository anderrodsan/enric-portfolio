# Overview.

Amber Alerts are an essential tool for locating missing children. However, the current user experience (UX) often falls short, with unclear messages and limited actionability leading to reduced engagement. By focusing on usability, we can create a design that encourages quick comprehension, actionable steps, and user empathy—ultimately increasing the likelihood of timely recoveries.

In this project, I redesigned the Amber Alert experience with five critical UX improvements to make alerts more intuitive, relevant, and actionable for users.

# The challenge.

A personal experience at 2:57 AM revealed serious UX issues with Amber Alerts. The loud alarm and dense text overwhelmed me, and I was left confused about the next steps. Common UX challenges with Amber Alerts include:

- <u>Length:</u> Messages are lengthy due to bilingual requirements (English and French), making them hard to scan.
- <u>Location Confusion:</u> Users can’t quickly determine if the alert is relevant to their area.
- <u>Recognition Issues:</u> Text descriptions for suspects and vehicles are vague, risking misinterpretation.
- <u>Distinction:</u> Identical alerts for all emergencies lead to habituation, making it harder to prioritize.
- <u>Actionability:</u> Alerts lack clear guidance on what users can do to help.

# UX Goals and Objectives

- Enhance user clarity by simplifying message structure and language.
- Improve engagement with alerts through visuals and relevant information.
- Enable quick action by guiding users to report sightings or assist.
- Provide closure for users to build positive associations with responding to alerts.

# Key Design Improvements

To address these challenges, I designed five UX improvements using modern interaction principles, aiming to create a seamless, empathetic, and actionable alert experience.

Language Settings & Conciseness

- <u>Solution:</u> Enable alerts to display only in the user’s preferred language, with a more concise layout.
- <u>Execution:</u> Emphasized critical information (e.g., child’s name, description, action steps) and reduced non-essential text.
- <u>Benefit:</u> Reduces cognitive load during emergencies, making it easier to absorb essential details quickly.

Location Relevance with Live Mapping

- <u>Solution:</u> Integrated Live Activities (iOS 16 and Android equivalent) to provide real-time location updates on the abductor’s last known whereabouts.
- <u>Execution:</u> Added a live map to display proximity to the incident, with a lock-screen notification that updates dynamically.
- <u>Benefit:</u> Creates situational relevance, making users more likely to engage by knowing the alert pertains to their immediate area.

Visual Cues for Quick Recognition

- <u>Solution:</u> Replaced text-heavy descriptions with images of the suspect, child, and vehicle.
- <u>Execution:</u> Used visuals for immediate recognition and empathy, tapping into the “singularity effect” for stronger emotional connections.
- <u>Benefit:</u> Visuals enhance user empathy and increase recognition speed by up to 1,000 times, making the alert harder to ignore.

Action-Oriented Design

- <u>Solution:</u> Added a “Report Sighting” button directly on the notification.
- <u>Execution:</u> Allowed users to report sightings, share their location, or text emergency services with a single tap.
- <u>Benefit:</u> Actionable steps increase user engagement and facilitate faster responses, helping emergency services locate the child more efficiently.

Closure for Emotional Resolution

- <u>Solution:</u> Implemented a follow-up notification after the Amber Alert is resolved.
- <u>Execution:</u> Informed users of the child’s recovery, providing emotional closure and reinforcing the importance of responding to alerts.
- <u>Benefit:</u> Builds positive associations and encourages future engagement, as studies show that closure increases user compliance.

# Design process & Best practices.

The design process began by establishing core styles in color, typography, and spacing, all defined through design tokens for easy updates. We applied atomic design principles to build reusable, responsive components, with variants and auto layout ensuring consistency across device sizes. Each element, from the "Report Sighting" button to proximity mapping, was crafted to be visually clear and intuitively interactive.

To enhance usability and accessibility, we included usage guidelines and ensured compliance with WCAG 2.2 standards. Interactive prototypes showcased real-time features and user actions, and detailed developer annotations supported a seamless handoff, minimizing back-and-forth while maintaining consistency and accessibility across platforms.

# Outcome and Impact.

- <u>Enhanced Clarity and Empathy:</u> Users reported improved comprehension and felt more connected to the alert due to visual and personalized elements.
- <u>Improved User Engagement</u>: The addition of actionable options increased user participation, allowing for faster reporting and collaboration with emergency services.
- <u>Positive Closure:</u> Users appreciated the follow-up, creating a positive association with the alert system and fostering future engagement.

# Reflection & Lessons Learned.

This project demonstrated how thoughtful UX design can make alerts not only more effective but also more humane. By addressing clarity, relevance, and actionability, we created a solution that is easy to engage with during high-stress situations. Moving forward, I would explore additional ways to integrate user feedback and ensure adaptability for future updates.
